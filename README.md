first we have the menu screen,
in it you can pick what mode do you want to play,the modes are: fast or normal and play by rotating the phone or by buttons.
you enter your name before entering a game and that name uses at the scoreboard, if you didn't fill any name it will put a default name that is UNNAMED.
in the manu screen you can go to the scoreboard screen.

at the scoreboard screen you can see the 10 highest scores since the app downloaded to the device,
for each record you can see the name of the player, the score and the coordinates in which the score was made.
when you click on a score it zoomed to the place in the map it appears.
there are markers on the map for each of the records.
and you have a back button to go back to the menu.

at the game over screen, you can see your name and the score you got.
you can go to the scoreboard from there or to the menu by the back button at the top left,
or do play again that starts a new game with the same name and the same mode played.

at the game itself - 
you have the speed the score and the lives left.
if you hit a flip flop you lose a life, hitting a poop would give you a score bonus, both of them has diffrent sound effects.
normal mode which uses buttons in order to move.
rotate mode that uses sensors in order to move by tilting the phone right and left, when tilting backwards and forwards the speed changes.
also there is the high speed mode that could be played in each of the modes explained.
when you lose you go to the game over screen.



in the example video:

first game is a normal game you can see the sound effect of getting hit and the sound of collecting a bonus.
plus the normal speed that is written at the bottom of the screen and the score at the top.
then you can see the loser screen and the score board screen.

second game is a high speed game with normal buttons.

third game is a rotate mode game without buttons rotate right and left in order to move,
also you can see the speed going up and down, that speed changes are made by tilting the device forwards and backwards.
and at the begging of the game the name check entered in ordered to show it at the scoreboard and as you can see the score has been added at the right location,
and when you click on it it shows it on the map(zooming and the name of the marker pops).
